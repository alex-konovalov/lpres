\Chapter{Approximating the Schur multiplier}

The algorithm in~\cite{Har09} approximates the Schur multiplier of
an invariantly finitely $L$-presented group by the quotients in its
Dwyer-filtration. This is implemented in the \NQL-package and the
following methods are available:

\> GeneratingSetOfMultiplier( <LpGroup> ) A

uses Tietze transformations for computing an equivalent set of relators
for <LpGroup> so that a generating set for its Schur multiplier can be
read off easily.

\> FiniteRankSchurMultiplier( <LpGroup>, <c> ) O

computes a finitely generated quotient of the Schur multiplier of
<LpGroup>. The method computes the image of the Schur multiplier of
<LpGroup> in the Schur multiplier of its class-<c> quotient.

\> EndomorphismsOfFRSchurMultiplier ( <LpGroup>, <c> )  O

computes a list of endomorphisms of the `FiniteRankSchurMultiplier' of
<LpGroup>. These are the endomorphisms of the invariant $L$-presentation
induced to `FiniteRankSchurMultiplier'.

\> EpimorphismCoveringGroups( <LpGroup>, <d>, <c> ) O

computes an epimorphism of the covering group of the class-<d> quotient
onto the covering group of the class-<c> quotient.

\> EpimorphismFiniteRankSchurMultiplier( <LpGroup>, <d>, <c> ) O

computes an epimorphism of the $d$-th `FiniteRankSchurMultiplier' of
the invariant <LpGroup> onto the $c$-th `FiniteRankSchurMultiplier'.
Its restricts the epimorphism `EpimorphismCoveringGroups' to the
corresponding finite rank multipliers.

\> ImageInFiniteRankSchurMultiplier( <LpGroup>, <c>, <elm> ) F

computes the image of the free group element <elm> in the <c>-th
`FiniteRankSchurMultiplier'. Note that <elm> must be a relator contained
in the Schur multiplier of <LpGroup>; otherwise, the function fails in
computing the image.

The following example tackels the Schur multiplier of the Grigorchuk 
group.
