<Chapter><Heading>P-Quotients of L-presented groups</Heading>

The nilpotent quotient algorithm for finitely L-presented groups and the
p-quotient algorithm for finitely presented group <Cite Key=""> readily
generalize to an algorithm for computing a polycyclic presentation for
the p-quotient of a L-presented group.

<ManSection><Oper Name="NqPQuotient" Arg="g p [c]"/>
<Description>
returns a polycyclic presentation for the <A>p</A>-class-<A>c</A> quotient
<M>g/\phi_{c+1}(g)</M> of the L-presented group <A>g</A> if <A>c</A>
is specified. If <A>c</A> is not given, this method attempts to
compute the largest <A>p</A>-quotient of <A>g</A> and will terminate
only if <A>g</A> has such a largest <A>p</A>-quotient.<P/>

The following example computes the 2-class-5 quotient of the Grigorchuk
group.
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> G:=ExamplesOfLPresentations( 1 );;
gap> H:=NqPQuotient( G, 2, 5 );
Pcp-group with orders [ 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ]
gap> pcs := PCentralSeries( H );
[ Pcp-group with orders [ 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ], Pcp-group with orders [ 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ],
  Pcp-group with orders [ 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ], Pcp-group with orders [ 2, 2, 2 ], Pcp-group with orders [ 2, 2 ],
  Pcp-group with orders [  ] ]

<ManSection><Oper Name="NqEpimorphismPQuotient" Arg="g p [c]"/>
<Description>
This method returns an epimorphism from the L-presented group
<A>g</A> onto a <A>p</A>-quotient. If the optional argument <A>c</A>
is given, the epimorphism is onto the maximal class-<A>c</A> quotient
<M>g//\phi_{c+1}(g)</M>. If no second argument is given, this method
attempts to compute an epimorphism onto the largest <A>p</A>-quotient
of <A>g</A>. If <A>g</A> does not have a largest <A>p</A>-quotient,
this method will not terminate.<P/>

The following example computes an epimorphism from the Grigorchuk group
onto its 2-class-5 quotients.

<Example><![CDATA[
gap> G:=ExamplesOfLPresentations( 1 );
<invariant LpGroup of size infinity on the generators [ a, b, c, d ]>
gap> epi := NqEpimorphismPQuotient( G, 2, 5 );
[ a, b, c, d ] -> [ g1, g2*g3, g2, g3 ]
gap> H := Image(epi);
Pcp-group with orders [ 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ]
gap> PClassPGroup( H );
