The nilpotent quotient algorithm for finitely L-presented groups
and the p-quotient algorithm for finitely L-presented group <Cite
Key=""> generalize to an algorithm for computing a polycyclic
presentation for the quotients of an L-presented group by the
elements of the Jennings-Zassenhaus-Lazard series given recursively
by <M>\kappa_1g = g</M> and <M>\kappa_{n+1}g = [\kappa_{n}g,g]
(\kappa_{\ceil{\frac{n+1}{p}}}G)^p</M>.

<Description>
returns a polycyclic presentation for the <A>p</A>-Jennings class-<A>c</A> quotient
<M>g/\kappa_{c+1}(g)</M> of the L-presented group <A>g</A> if <A>c</A>
is specified. If <A>c</A> is not given, this method attempts to
compute the largest <A>p</A>-quotient of <A>g</A> and will terminate
only if <A>g</A> has such a largest <A>p</A>-quotient.<P/>

The following example computes the 2-Jennings class-5 quotient of the
Grigorchuk group.

<ManSection><Oper Name="NqEpimorphismPQuotient" Arg="g p [c]"/>
<Description>
This method returns an epimorphism from the L-presented group
<A>g</A> onto a <A>p</A>-Jennings quotient. If the optional argument <A>c</A>
is given, the epimorphism is onto the maximal class-<A>c</A> quotient
<M>g//\kappa_{c+1}(g)</M>. If no second argument is given, this method
attempts to compute an epimorphism onto the largest <A>p</A>-quotient
of <A>g</A>. If <A>g</A> does not have a largest <A>p</A>-quotient,
this method will not terminate.<P/>

The following example computes an epimorphism from the Grigorchuk group
onto its 2-class-5 quotients.

<Example><![CDATA[
gap> G := ExamplesOfLPresentations(1);
<invariant LpGroup of size infinity on the generators [ a, b, c, d ]>
gap> epi := EpimorphismJenningsQuotient( G, 2, 6 );
[ a, b, c, d ] -> [ g1, g2*g3, g2, g3 ]
gap> Range( epi );
